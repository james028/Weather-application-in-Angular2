Weather application made in Angular2.

link: www.searchweather.pl


I made weather application in Angular2.
I use API from https://openweathermap.org/.

In my app I made two links. We can see weather for any location and We can see weather for your current location.
This app is full responsive.


Features Angular2 who I use: 
- ngModel
- ngSubmit
- ngForm
- rxjs
- routing
- Observable    
- http




In future I want to do new link with weather forecast...
